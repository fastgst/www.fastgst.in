                        We store logs and generate operational and aggregated reports for monitoring, troubleshooting, usage analytics, and product improvement. Reports may include aggregated or pseudonymized usage statistics; we do not intentionally include unnecessary personal identifiers in aggregated reports.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">4. Passwords & Authentication</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Account passwords are stored securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms. We use strong password hashing practices (for example, bcrypt or Argon2) combined with appropriate salts and configuration to protect credentials. Plain-text passwords are never stored.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        If you use third-party authentication (OAuth, SSO), the authentication provider's terms and policies apply.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">5. Hosting, Storage & Third-Party Processors</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        We use Microsoft Azure to host our services and process data. Our primary storage and compute for customer data is located in the Central India (Pune/Chennai) region of Azure, unless otherwise disclosed.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Third-Party Services</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        We use trusted third-party services for analytics, email delivery, payments, monitoring, backups, and other operational needs. These subprocessors receive only the data necessary to perform their functions and are contractually bound to protect it.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">6. Data Retention</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        We retain personal and account information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Typical retention periods (configurable by policy and legal needs):
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                        <li>Account information and billing records: retained for the duration of the account and up to 7 years after account closure for legal and tax purposes.</li>
                        <li>API request logs and metadata: retained for 12 months for monitoring, debugging, and abuse prevention (may be retained longer in aggregated/anonymized form).</li>
                        <li>Backups: retained per our backup schedule (typically up to 90 days) and protected as described in the Security section.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        If you request deletion of your account, we will remove or anonymize your personal data from regular systems within a reasonable period, except where retention is required for legal or legitimate business purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">7. Data Security</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                        <li>Encryption in transit using TLS for all web and API traffic</li>
                        <li>Encryption at rest for stored data (Azure-managed encryption)</li>
                        <li>Role-based access controls and least-privilege access for internal systems</li>
                        <li>Secure password hashing for credentials</li>
                        <li>Regular security reviews, monitoring, and logging</li>
                        <li>Periodic vulnerability scanning and patch management</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        While we take strong precautions, no system is entirely risk-free. If we become aware of a security breach affecting personal data, we will investigate promptly and notify affected users and authorities as required by applicable law (we aim to notify affected users and regulators without undue delay and, where applicable, within 72 hours of becoming aware of a qualifying breach).
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">8. Cross-Border Transfers</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        Data processed by FastGST.in is stored in Azure's Central India region. If at any time data is transferred outside of this region (for example, to a global Azure service or a third-party processor), we will ensure appropriate contractual and technical protections are in place to safeguard the data consistent with applicable laws.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">9. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        We will not sell or rent your personal data. We may share data in limited circumstances:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">10. Reporting & Use of Aggregated Data</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        We generate operational and product reports derived from usage data. Where possible, reports are aggregated and pseudonymized to prevent identification of individual users. We may use aggregated insights internally and productively to improve services, and to provide anonymized benchmarking to customers where agreed.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">11. Your Rights & Controls</h2>
