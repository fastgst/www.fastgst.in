                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        FastGST.in is a platform that provides GST Tax Lookup API services, offering access to accurate GST tax rates, HSN/SAC codes, and classification data for Indian businesses and developers. We're operated by Sangeeth Nandakumar, an independent developer passionate about building solutions that solve real problems.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        FastGST.in was born from a simple observation: India's GST system is complex, but accessing accurate tax information shouldn't be. As businesses digitize, they need reliable access to GST tax rates, HSN/SAC codes, and classification data. But existing solutions were scattered, outdated, or too expensive for small businesses and developers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                        We saw an opportunity to build something better - a centralized, developer-friendly API that makes GST compliance simple and accessible for businesses of all sizes.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
